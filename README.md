# 💫 Hi, I'm Deon – Welcome to my world!

🎓 I'm Thomas Shikalepo, a Computer Science student at the Namibia University of Science and Technology.  
💻 I love building backend systems, analyzing data, and creating things that matter.  
🌱 I'm learning not just about code, but also about life—its meaning and its joy.  
😅 I don’t always know what I’m doing, but I enjoy the process and keep going anyway! 😂
